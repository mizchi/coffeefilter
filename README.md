# CoffeeFilter <☕/>

This is my branch of the original
[Coffeekup](https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup). I have great plans, but

Changes from CoffeeKup:

* Supports express 3.0.0beta5
* Supports CoffeeScript 1.3.3
* Supports template inheritance with the `base` function, and injecting
	content into the parent template with the `block` function.
* `yield` has been renamed to `cede` to work with newer CoffeeScript versions

Not safe for production use...

## Markup as CoffeeScript

CoffeeFilter is a templating engine for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and browsers
that lets you to write your HTML templates in 100% pure
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).

It was created in celebration of [whyday](http://whyday.org/), as an
application of the concept used in
[Markaby](https://github.com/markaby/markaby) ("Markup as Ruby", by Tim
Fletcher and why the lucky stiff) to CoffeeScript.

Here's what a template written for CoffeeFilter looks like:

~~~ coffeescript
doctype 5
html ->
	head ->
		meta charset: 'utf-8'
		title "#{@title or 'Untitled'} | A completely plausible website"
		meta(name: 'description', content: @description) if @description?

		link rel: 'stylesheet', href: '/css/app.css'

		style '''
			body {font-family: sans-serif}
			header, nav, section, footer {display: block}
		'''

		script src: '/js/jquery.js'

		coffeescript ->
			$(document).ready ->
				alert 'Alerts suck!'
	body ->
		header ->
			h1 @title or 'Untitled'

			nav ->
				ul ->
					(li -> a href: '/', -> 'Home') unless @path is '/'
					li -> a href: '/chunky', -> 'Bacon!'
					switch @user.role
						when 'owner', 'admin'
							li -> a href: '/admin', -> 'Secret Stuff'
						when 'vip'
							li -> a href: '/vip', -> 'Exclusive Stuff'
						else
							li -> a href: '/commoners', -> 'Just Stuff'

		div '#myid.myclass.anotherclass', style: 'position: fixed', ->
			p 'Divitis kills! Inline styling too.'

		section ->
			# A helper function you built and included.
			breadcrumb separator: '>', clickable: yes

			h2 "Let's count to 10:"
			p i for i in [1..10]

			# Another hypothetical helper.
			form_to @post, ->
				textbox '#title', label: 'Title:'
				textbox '#author', label: 'Author:'
				submit 'Save'

		footer ->
			# CoffeeScript comments. Not visible in the output document.
			comment 'HTML comments.'
			p 'Bye!'

## _why?

- **One language to rule them all**. JavaScript is everywhere, thus so is
	CoffeeScript. Servers, browsers, even databases. If extending this to
	rendering logic and UI structure (server and client side) is desirable to
	you, CoffeeFilter is your friend.

- **More specifically, one _outstanding_ language**. CoffeeScript is one hell
	of a clean, expressive, flexible and powerful language. It's hard to find
	such combination, especially if you need it to run in the browser too.

- **Not yet another specialized language to learn**. Transferable knowledge
	FTW.

- **Embed your templates in CoffeeScript nicely**. Templates are just
	functions, so they don't lose syntax highlighting and syntax checking when
	embedded in CoffeeScript apps.

- **Embed CoffeeScript in your templates nicely**. In the same manner, you can
	write the contents of `<script>` blocks in CoffeeScript, and keep the
	highlighting. Perhaps more significantly, the CoffeeScript compiler doesn't
	have to be called just to convert these blocks to JS, as in other templating
	engines.

- **Extensive editor support**. You benefit from the already existing list of
	excellent CoffeeScript [text editor
	plugins](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/Text-editor-plugins).

- **Client-server consistency**. The same template language _and_
	implementation in node.js or the browser.

- **Easily extendable into a higher level "DSL"**. Since all elements are just
	functions, it's very easy to define your own custom "tags", which will work
	and look the same as "native" ones.

- **HTML 5 ready**. Boring legacy doctypes and elements also available.

- **Optional auto-escaping**. You can also use the `h` helper on a case-by-case
	basis.

- **Optional formatting**, with line breaks and indentation.

- **Pick your poison**. Works with both CoffeeScript and JavaScript apps.

## Why not?

CoffeeFilter may not be your best choice in those cases:

- You're after the cleanest syntax possible, above all. In this regard a
	specialized language such as [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) just can't be
	beaten.

- You use divs and/or classes for everything. While in CoffeeFilter you can do
	`div '#id.class.class'`, specialized languages often have an even shorter
	syntax for that.

- You want CoffeeScript for rendering logic, but you'd rather stick with HTML
	for markup. Then you're looking for [Eco](http://github.com/sstephenson/eco).

- For your specific project/team/preferences, you think a limited and/or
	separate language for templating is actually beneficial.

## Installing

**TODO: add CoffeeFilter to npm**

Just grab [node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download) and
[npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm) and you're set:

    npm install coffeefilter

To get the `coffeefilter` command, install it globally:

    npm install coffeefilter -g

Or to use the latest version:

    git clone git@github.com:tgwizard/coffeefilter.git && cd coffeefilter
    cake build
    npm link
    cd ~/myproject
    npm link coffeefilter

## Using

~~~ coffeescript
cf = require 'coffeefilter'

cf.render -> h1 "You can feed me templates as functions."
cf.render "h1 'Or strings. I am not too picky.'"
~~~

Defining variables:
**TODO: rewrite this, this is not how it works**

~~~ coffeescript
template = ->
	h1 @title
	form method: 'post', action: 'login', ->
		textbox id: 'username'
		textbox id: 'password'
		button @title

helpers =
	textbox: (attrs) ->
		attrs.type = 'text'
		attrs.name = attrs.id
		input attrs

cf.render(template, title: 'Log In', hardcode: helpers)
~~~

Precompiling to functions:

~~~ coffeescript
template = cf.compile(template, locals: yes, hardcode: {zig: 'zag'})

template(foo: 'bar', locals: {ping: 'pong'})
~~~

With [express](http://expressjs.com):

~~~ coffeescript
coffeefilter = require 'coffeefilter'
app.set 'view engine', 'coffee'
app.engine '.coffee', coffeefilter.adapters.express

app.get '/', (req, res) ->
	# Will render views/index.coffee:
	res.render 'index', foo: 'bar'
~~~

With [zappa](http://github.com/mauricemach/zappa):

~~~ coffeescript
get '/': ->
	@franks = ['miller', 'oz', 'sinatra', 'zappa']
	render 'index'

view index: ->
	for name in @franks
		a href: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_#{name}", -> name
~~~

With
[meryl](https://github.com/kadirpekel/meryl/tree/master/examples/coffeekup-template):

~~~ coffeescript
coffeefilter = require 'coffeefilter'

meryl.get '/', (req, resp) ->
	people = ['bob', 'alice', 'meryl']
	resp.render 'layout', content: 'index', context: {people: people}

meryl.run
	templateExt: '.coffee'
	templateFunc: coffeefilter.adapters.meryl
~~~

On the browser:
**TODO: make sure this works, it probably doesn't now**

~~~ html
<script src="template.js"></script>
<script>
	$('body').append(templates.template({foo: 'bar'}));
</script>
~~~

This is one of many browser deployment possibilities, pre-compiling your
template on the server to a standalone function. To see all serving
suggestions, check out
[regular](http://github.com/tgwizard/coffeefilter/blob/master/examples/browser/regular/index.html),
[decaf](http://github.com/tgwizard/coffeefilter/blob/master/examples/browser/decaf/index.html)
and
[crème](http://github.com/tgwizard/coffeefilter/blob/master/examples/browser/creme/index.html).

Command-line:

    $ coffeefilter -h

    Usage:
      coffeefilter [options] path/to/template.coffee

          --js           compile template to js function
      -n, --namespace    global object holding the templates (default: "templates")
      -w, --watch        watch templates for changes, and recompile
      -o, --output       set the directory for compiled html
      -p, --print        print the compiled html to stdout
      -f, --format       apply line breaks and indentation to html output
      -u, --utils        add helper locals (currently only "render")
      -v, --version      display CoffeeFilter version
      -h, --help         display this help message

See [/examples](http://github.com/tgwizard/coffeefilter/tree/master/examples)
for complete versions (you have to run `cake build` first).

Please note that even though all examples are given in CoffeeScript, you can
also use their plain JavaScript counterparts just fine.
